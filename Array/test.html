        </p>
        <p> The Last Quarter Lunar Return for you signifies a period of reflection and evaluation rather than new
            beginnings. It's a time to assess how you've been utilizing your time and what you have already achieved.
        </p>
        <p> This phase suggests that it's not an ideal time to start new projects or ventures. Instead, focus on
            completing existing tasks and tying up loose ends. Take this time to review your progress and make necessary
            adjustments. </p>
        <p> The Moon being in a waning phase indicates a decrease in energy and momentum. It's a time to conserve your
            resources and avoid taking on too much. Reflect on your emotional state and address any lingering issues
            that need resolution. </p>
        <p> The square aspect between the Moon and the Sun highlights tension and challenges. You may feel conflicted or
            at odds with external influences. It's important to find balance and harmony within yourself during this
            period. </p>
        <p> Use this time to declutter your mind and surroundings. Let go of what no longer serves you and make room for
            new growth in the upcoming lunar cycle. Embrace change and transformation as you move towards a new phase in
            your life. </p>
        <p> Remember to be patient with yourself and others during this period. Allow space for introspection and
            self-care. Trust that this phase is part of a larger cycle of growth and renewal in your life. </p>
        <p> Stay grounded and connected to your inner wisdom. Seek guidance from your intuition and inner voice to
            navigate through any challenges that may arise. Embrace the lessons that this Lunar Return brings and emerge
            stronger and wiser. </p>
